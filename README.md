# Python - Py Me Up, Charlie

Py Bank

Created a python script for analyzing financial records for a company. The python script analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

    The total number of months included in the dataset
    The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
    The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
    The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
    The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

Py Poll

In order to help a small rural town modernize its vote-counting process, I created a python script that analyzes a set of poll data from a recent election. The python script analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

    The total number of votes cast
    A complete list of candidates who received votes
    The percentage of votes each candidate won
    The total number of votes each candidate won
    The winner of the election based on popular vote.
